# Crowdsourced-based Mobile Application with Sentiment Analysis for Local Tourist Attractions
# Welcome to the Adtour GitHub Repository!
Derived from the Hiligaynon/Ilonggo word, ádto means “it is there” or in some Panay Island provinces, it also means “let’s go there” combined with an English term, tour means “a journey for pleasure in which several different places are visited.”

The Adtour mobile application guides tourists in Iloilo City to notable tourist attractions with the aid of crowdsourced information from other tourists. To make it easier for tourists to access at a glance, this crowdsourced information will be classified as positive (green) or negative (red). It also includes a map feature to navigate tourist attractions and determine the nearest attraction based on the user’s location with the check-in feature.


This research generally aims to develop a mobile 
crowdsourcing-based application for local tourist attractions with sentiment analysis.
Specifically, it aimed to:
1. Collect feedback from tourists as data to visit based on their experiences using crowdsourcing.
2. Implement sentiment analysis to classify tourist’s crowdsourced information as positive or negative using Tensorflow Lite.
3. Deploy a heat map based on sentiment analysis that can assist tourism officers to identify which tourism destinations are in need of improvements using Mapbox.
4. Generate analytics reports including quantitative tourism visits and qualitative tourism review using sentiment analysis.
5. Evaluate the functionalities and efficiency of the system based on ISO Software Evaluation Standard.
